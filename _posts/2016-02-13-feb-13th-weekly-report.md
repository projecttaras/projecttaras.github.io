This is my first blog post! 
We're making good progress with project TARAS. We had a small meeting today. We reviewed our progress and assigned jobs to each other. We attended a session on Thursday (11th Feb. 2016) at which our senior(Sudheesh BTech CSE 4/4) shared his and his team's experience of the EPICS programme. This has helped us gain some perspective on how we can go about our project more efficiently. 
He also shared the Do's and Dont's so that we do not repeat the mistakes our seniors made in the last EPICS programme.

HackFriday was postponed due to the commencement of minors. We have hence, assigned individual jobs (not overlapping) to each other!
**Rishabh** made a note of key points of the discussion. He will blog it soon!

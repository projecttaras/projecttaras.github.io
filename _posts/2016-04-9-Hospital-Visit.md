This week the team decided to talk to some real time stake holders, which are the officials who participate an active role during an emergency accident situation. So we decided to visit some hospitals and police station in Hanamkonda district. The team spilt as to cover more ground, Aneesh and Vivek went to the local police station whereas me and Rishabh went to Rohini Hospital.

We spoke to the officials about our epics project and how it can be used to minimise accident risks, the hospital officials and doctors were eagerly ready to help us on the project. We spoke to DR. Thirupathi and Dr. Jyothy Maâ€™am from the causality ward and miss Sindhu from the reception. They said that as of now they were not following any real time computerised system to help then in accident but they normally receive calls to either the hospital or ambulance or even sometimes get directives from the 108 help line service. 
<br>
The information normally required by the hospitals include the location of accidents, the type of accidents and the number of people injured. The hospital also requires a patient attendee who will take care of the patient once reported, this role is normally taken up by the person who either called the hospital or the one who brings the patient to the hospital. And this role cannot be abandoned unless it was replaced by another known contact of the patient.

Dr. Thirupathi also told us that 108 cases are normally forwarded to government hospitals in the district, unless the case is of utmost importance. So that means in the district of Warangal most of the cases goes to Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hospital in Sherpura.

The hospital also gave us contact to Mr Sundar and Mr.Prabad of the Warangal 108 division for further information. We thanked the officials and the doctors on giving us good clean insight to an active case. They also suggested the management of a portal could be useful for them for faster response.
<br>
We were able to learn a lot from the above visit and will continue to make more to make our solution an effect one.

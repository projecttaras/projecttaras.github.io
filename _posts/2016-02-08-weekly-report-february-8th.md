As for the week before, we have completed getting the hardware. Sreerag is now in the process of checking out how to put together a prototype and also check if there are any relevant hardware that still needs to be purchased.

We had a meeting during the week, in which we discussed the possibility of working on an Mobile Application and releasing it before the end of the first sem of EPICS. Rishabh is checking it out. A mobile app will enable us to interact and get feedback from the end user whereby we can improve the system better.

Meanwhile, Aneesh is looking into the NHAI data. I have been assigned with the task of cleaning the Warangal data. I have started writing a script to enable faster location gathering. I am currently working on that part. Since there is lot of data, this might take some time. 

I have contacted a few organizations and NGOs. I haven't got any replies as of now but here is the list of companies I have contacted uptil now.

- Indian Federation of Road Safety
- Arrive Safe
- International NGO Safety Organisation
- SRF: Safe Road Foundation
- BMW iventures.

I will be getting back to then via call as well. So far progress is going as expected. We are planning to have a hack friday to complete some of the software parts faster.

We are delighted to inform about our patternship with Digital Ocean and Amazon. We have been proivided with free server space by both the companies.
Rishabh worked on getting these sponsor ships for our Project. Now we can move forward in full swing.

Other than that we are now moving into creating Portals for hospitals and Police stations. We also started the predictive phase and have
started looking into algorithims. We are leaning onto DB Scan algorithim but we are still in the process of finding better and more accurate algorithim.

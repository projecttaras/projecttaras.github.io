We have completed the tasks that were decided for the first semester of the EPICs program

These tasks included:

- Complete prototype of the accident detection blackbox

- Heat Map and Prediction system

As a bonus we have also completed the following tasks:

- **Mobile Application** that enables easier access for the site

- **A portal** for hospitals and police stations that gives real time data on accidents

Our first priority is to bring accidents to hospitals as quickly as possible

We also met with the following members of the community to understand the following:

- How our project can help them

- Loop holes if any

- What can we do to better suit the needs of the community

We have **3 main stakeholders**:

- People who have met with Accidents

- Hospitals

- Police Stations

So we decided to talk to Hospitals and Police Stations and get to know what are their views about the project:

- **Aneesh and I**: Visited the Hanamkonda Police Station

- **Rishabh and Sreerag**: Visited Rohini Hospital

**Individual Contributions**

- **Hardware setup and Prototype**: The hardware side of the project and the prototype was completed by Sreerag

- **Heatmap and Accident Prediction/Warning**: Aneesh took care of this task and completed the Map with the warning system

- **AWS setup and Portal Integration**: Rishabh worked on setting up the server and also helped with the Portal for hospitals and Police Stations

- **Meteor setup,overall site bug fixing, SMS integration**: I was helping out with the site bug fixing and also made SMS integration so as to get easier Accident data.

We have our first evaluation on 18th April. We have a few tests left which we plan to complete by 16th April.

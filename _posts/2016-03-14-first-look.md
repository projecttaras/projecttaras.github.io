The journey with Meteor JS has been amazing so far. As lot of awesome features and packages that make Meteor seamless. I would like to highlight some of these features

- Meteor server and client separation: Amazingly implemented feature and useful for segregating date between client and server
- Node JS usage: I had used Node JS before and I was happy to find that we can use almost all the packages of Node Js also with Meteor. One such useful package was the File System package enabling read and write operations on files in the server.

These are just some of the features that is making me love Meteor more and more. We started building the basic site now. We have uploaded the data and added an admin portal for easier management of Mongo Data. Currently we have around 300+ accident recorded. We are adding them slowly to the DB. Aneesh is working on the map view to show the various accidents around the area. 

Here are some of the screen shots of the application so far.

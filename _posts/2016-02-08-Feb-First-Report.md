I had conducted a workshop on IOT for ECE association on 6th to 7th February, this had helped me to refresh my concepts in Arduino and hardware management with the internet. I will begin to test the hardware and its calibration the following week.
Vivek has emailed a couple of companies and vendors to attain collaboration and support.

During the last epics meeting, DVSS Sarma Sir and Karthik Sir had asked us to finalise the purchases before the end of February as it is closing to financial break. They had also asked us to only find vendors who has a Tin no. (Tax Information Network) ie vendors registered with the government of India and pays taxes.

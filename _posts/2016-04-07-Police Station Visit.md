So, we decided that we needed to visit the Police Station(near Subedari) and drop our idea to them in order to understand how they would accept it and also understand their perspective better.

Hence, Vivek and I went to the Subedari Police Station this Tuesday(5th April 2016). We were a bit nervous because it was both our first times at the Police Station! But unexpectedly, our experience was very smooth.
The Police officers were very kind and very accepting. They had stools brought for us and listened to us patiently. I speak Telugu and so I communicated every little detail in Telugu in order to make them feel comfortable as well. 

We talked to an Inspector(L. Ravinder). He listened to our project idea keenly and appreciated it. He gave us some key insights and also pointed out a loophole. The loophole was that with our current system, we would be unable to track a user if, within the time period of an ambulance set out to pick up the victim and arriving at the scene of the accident, someone else notices the accident and initiates to help, thereby dropping the concerned to another hospital nearby. 
We had failed to identify this loophole before and we are still yet to come up with a robust solution to fill this loophole!

He also introduced us to the *108 Emergency Helpline* and informed us that the 108 and 100 helplines worked together very well and hence rather than informing the nearest Police Station, we could instead simulate a call somehow. This got us thinking and we are currently remodelling our project structure in order to involve the 108 emergency helpline.
I have emailed the HR of GVK EMRI(the institute handling the 108 services) asking for a thorough explanation of the entire process flow of the emergency helpline.
Awaiting the reply.


On the technical aspect, I converted the map to a heatmap using the HEATMAP google API. Looking to make it better by making it better by integrating a few statistics. As stated earlier, I had talked with our DATA MINING professor Dr. Subramanyam regarding the project for some help. I have completed the implementation of the algorithm he had suggested. Working on simulating it better. 

Cheers!

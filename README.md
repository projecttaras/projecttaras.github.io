#Project Taras

##What is Project Taras?

With the ever increasing demand of automobiles today has also seen a steady increase in traffic hazards and road accidents. Recent statistics has declared that there is one death every minute due to road accidents in India. This is a huge number, despite the measures our Government has taken to prevent accidents. Due to the lack of good emergency facilities in our country many precious lives are lost at the cost of time. In many situations, family members or ambulance services or the police authority cannot be informed on instance. This results in a delay of help reached out to the sufferer.

**Project TARAS (Terrestrial Accident Risk Avoidance System)** is aimed at reducing road accidents by using predictive analysis on areas that are accident prone and equipping vehicles with a hardware device that will trigger the closest ambulance service and police station. The package also includes First Aid services to treat casualties at the time of accident.
Our project aims on creating a safe and assured warning ecosystem for vehicles that aims at avoiding the risk of accidents because ultimately “Prevention is better than cure”.
